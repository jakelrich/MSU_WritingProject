\section{Background}

\begin{frame}{Generalized Linear Mixed Models}
  \begin{itemize}
        \item In ecological and evolutionary biology, ordinary linear models are not always well suited for data analysis.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Presence/absence and count data are two common situations where a linear model is not well suited (non-normal responses).
          \item Dependence between observations occur through repeated measures, clustered observations, or within spatial elements violate independence assumptions (correlated observations).
        \end{itemize}
        \item If both non-normal responses and correlated observations occur in a dataset, we can use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for estimation and inference.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Motivating Example}
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Owlet begging data from Roulin and Bersier (2007) is an example of a dataset suitable for analysis with GLMMs.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Data consist of 599 observations from 27 barn owl nests in western Switzerland.
          \item Response: number of calls in a 30 sec. interval before the parent arrived. 
          \item Covariates used: brood size, food treatment, and arrival time of parent (between 2130 and 0530 hours).
          \item Nest is treated as a random effect. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Observations are correlated at the nest level due to repeated measurements and the count data should follow a Poisson distribution. The resulting model is:
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Issues with Estimation}
	 \begin{block}{Problem:}
      The likelihood functions of GLMMs involve high-dimensional integrals that lack closed form solutions, making evaluation of the exact likelihood function essentially impossible. 
   \end{block}
   
   \begin{itemize}
		\item $f(Y_{ij}|b_i)$ and $f(b_i)$ are not normal distributions.
	\end{itemize}
   
   $$ L(\beta, D) = \prod_i \int f(Y_{ij}|b_i)f(b_i) db_i $$
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Because of that, approximations of the integration or of the likelihood function need to be used. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GLMM Estimation Methods}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In place of closed form solutions, a number of approximation methods have been developed since the first major introduction of GLMMs by McCullagh and Nelder (1989). Commonly used approximations include:
    	\begin{itemize}
    	  \item Laplace Approximation
    		\item (Adaptive) Gaussian Hermite Quadrature (AGHQ)
    		\item Penalized Quasi-likelihood
    	\end{itemize}
		\item Bayesian approaches to GLMMs are also commonly used as it sidesteps the issues integration issues involved with the exact likelihood.
		\item Non-Bayesian Monte Carlo methods are available, but their implementation is not easy and are poorly documented.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Laplace Approximation and AGHQ}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Laplace approximation relies on a Taylor series approximation of the likelihood function to give an integrable result.
		\item Adaptive Gaussian Hermite Quadrature is a generalization of Laplace approximation, and AGHQ with one quadrature point is Laplacian approximation. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Penalized Quasi-likelihood}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PQL for GLMMs was introduced by Breslow and Clayton and relies on a Laplace approximation of the likelihood.
	  \begin{itemize}
		  \item Quasi-likelihoods are not related to a true probability distribution, only specifying the relationship between the mean and variance.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Implementing PQL relies on weighted least-squares for estimating the mean parameters and uses an approximating normal model for estimation of the variance components.
		\item One issue with PQL is that it can result in downwardly biased variance component estimates. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bayesian Approach}
	
	Need to flesh out the model/priors here. 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adapted JAGS code from Zuur.
		\item Relied on weakly informative priors.
		\item Focused on posterior means for comparisons.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Simulation Study}

\begin{frame}{Data Generation and Study Design}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The {\tt simr} package was used to generate new responses based on an original Poisson GLMM fit to the owlet data, fixing all covariates and random effects.
		\item For each iteration of the simulation, models using the four estimation models were fit. 
		\item Estimates of the fixed effects, random effects, and the variance of the random effects were recorded.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pretty empirical sampling distributions of selected components.
		\item Will be comparing bias, spread, and distribution across methods. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It's likely that {\tt glmer} works just fine in most cases, especially when using AGHQ, and is adequate in most cases. 
		\item PQL to show biased variance component estimates for small cluster sizes, but with large samples it doesn't matter much. 
		\item Extensions: using {\tt simr} to change aspects of the model to see how performance differs for other cases. 
	\end{itemize}
